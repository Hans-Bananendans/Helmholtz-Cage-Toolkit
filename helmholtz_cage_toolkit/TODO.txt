 ==== SERVER-SIDE ====

After implementing Bm_sim opts, rewrite
    example_script_client.py
    example_script_client2.py

Reset Bc on disconnect of client
Better name and versioning
Sort functions in handle() alphabetically


 ==== CLIENT-SIDE ====
Enable_on_connect shortcut: make one object that items can add themselves after
creation, so you have one object to call, and just have to ensure the item is
in there when program starts.


? Implications of bpacket -> tpacket, change related functions

Overview of all timers + timing events + conditions + locations
In CommandWindow, connect UI elements:

    Offset controls + set Bd, think about how to present (vector TO reject or REJECTED VECTOR?)
    Checks + play becoming available
    Reset button
    Manual+schedule buttons
    Recording controls
    Envelope graph for schedule
Disable play controls section in manual mode
Flip-over for manual input (disconnected state)
Flip-overs for Bm_display and graphs
Think of checks and hook all the condis in:
    - Connected to server (duh)
    - Verified server schedule with GUI schedule (uncertified when schedule
        changes)
    - Data is coming in from HHC
    - Recording armed

HHCPlot -> Antialiasing possible?
HHCPlot -> Generalize plotting functions for different directions
HHCPlot -> Make direction of plots specifyable in config
Apply all-new HHCPlot class to CyclicsWindow
How to record incoming data?

Gather generation parameters for Orbital Generator
Build generator function as separate tool
Build code example
Input Groupwidget
Play control widget
Orbital representation plot with play controls
HHCPlot for OrbitalWindow
Test OrbitalWindow schedules with spacecraft in circular orbit with
    "inertial fixture" i.e. rotating reversely to its orbit, and benchmark
    IGRF data at a few points for verification section in thesis.
Placeholder picture for "Webcam feed"
Retire old ControlWindow


 ==== OVERVIEW OF TIMERS ====
Housekeeping: Periodic exchange of schedule data with server
Housekeeping: One-off connect-on-boot
Housekeeping: One-off post-play reset
Getting of t-packets from server 1-100 S/s.
During play mode: schedule synchs (probably 1 to a few S/s)
