"""
This is an all-in-one test script to test and benchmark most functionalities
of the server.


WORK IN PROGRESS

While this version uses QTcpSocket which results in more representative test,
you have to embed this into a Qt implementation. Doing so means that the tests
will be executed as part of the back-end Qt event loop, which has the tendency
to suppress any error messages to the terminal. The whole point of these tests
is to debug, and so this makes it rather poor for this purpose.
