Goal: 90-120 seconds of video impressions with music

Progression:
 1. HQ satellite in space
 2. Dark circuit boards and machines
 3. Software writing + simulation of magnetic field
 4. Assembling
 5. Crescendo of satellite starting to move in space + in cage
 6. Fade to thesis cover

Motifs:
 - Compass starting to twitch more and more
 - Light starting to get brighter and brighter, as design "dawns"
 - Moody


Story board:
DARK LIGHT
 - CGI satellite in space
 o Dark board with LEDs, sweeping back light
 o Dark PSUs (off), sweeping top lights
 o Dark HHC elements, sweeping side lights
 o Dark compass, no movement, sweeping light
 o B-roll: copper coil
 o B-roll: Paper design drawings, sweeping light across
 
MEDIUM LIGHT
 o Medium dark compass, slight twitch of needle
 o Medium light compass, slow circle
 o Fully lit compass, full circle, and dance
 o BIG POWER SWITCH BOOM
 o Plug in RPi cable ribbons into board
 o Plug in Power supply ribbons + light turn on
 o Turn on power supply units
 o Watch PSU light come on in succession (alt shot)
 o Plug in 12 VDC barrel jack
 o Hanging satellite model from ceiling
 o Plugging in satellite model power cable
 o Turning on magnetometer and seeing screens
 o B-roll: Some RPi terminal
 o B-roll: Turn on COILS LIVE LED

HIGH LIGHT
 - CGI satellite starting to rotate
 o Satellite starting to rotate (various angles)
 o Close-up of XYZ LEDs
 o Closeup of PSU currents
 o Operator inspecting satellite rotating
 o Helmholtz cage setup with pretty screen (+operator)
 o Overview shot of setup
 o Top view of satellite moving maybe
 o Satellite as it rotates, using wire suspension
 - PC graphs sliding during test
 - PC satellite motion in virtuo
 - PC cage plot in virtuo
 
Others:
 o B-roll: Paper design drawings
 o B-roll: soldering microscope, board panning and zooming
 o Elevator light as it ascends
